/** A pileup builder that builds coordinate-maintaining or advancing pileups using lazy end-to-end BAM streaming.
  *
  * For every call to <pileup>, this class will advance <records> until SAM records are found that overlap the requested
  * locus. These records will be loaded into an internal cache and then a pileup will be built from them. The pileup
  * will be cached in the event a coordinate-maintaining call to <pileup> is made in the future. If another
  * coordinate-advancing call is made to <pileup> then any previous SAM records are evicted from the internal cache that
  * do not overlap the requested locus and <records> will be advanced to find all additional SAM records that overlap
  * the requested locus.
  *
  * @param records a by-name iterator of SAM records that is assumed to be coordinate-sorted.
  * @param dict the sequence dictionary associated with the records we will pileup.
  * @param minBaseQ the minimum base quality that a base must have to contribute to a pileup.
  * @param minMapQ the minimum mapping quality a record must have to contribute to a pileup.
  * @param mappedPairsOnly if true, only allow paired records with both records mapped to contribute to a pileup.
  * @param includeDuplicates if true, allow records flagged as duplicates to contribute to a pileup.
  * @param includeSecondaryAlignments if true, allow records flagged as secondary alignments to contribute to a pileup.
  * @param includeSupplementalAlignments if true, allow records flagged as supplementary alignments to contribute to a pileup.
  * @param includeMapPositionsOutsideFrInsert if true, include any record of an FR pair where the site requested is outside the insert.
  * @param initialCacheSize the initial size for the internal SAM record cache, set this to your expected pileup depth.
