    |Calls consensus sequences from reads with the same unique molecular tag.
    |
    |Reads with the same unique molecular tag are examined base-by-base to assess the likelihood of each base in the
    |source molecule.  The likelihood model is as follows:
    |
    |1. First, the base qualities are adjusted. The base qualities are assumed to represent the probability of a
    |   sequencing error (i.e. the sequencer observed the wrong base present on the cluster/flowcell/well). The base
    |   quality scores are converted to probabilities incorporating a probability representing the chance of an error
    |   from the time the unique molecular tags were integrated to just prior to sequencing.  The resulting probability
    |   is the error rate of all processes from right after integrating the molecular tag through to the end of
    |   sequencing.
    |2. Next, a consensus sequence is called for all reads with the same unique molecular tag base-by-base.  For a
    |   given base position in the reads, the likelihoods that an A, C, G, or T is the base for the underlying
    |   source molecule respectively are computed by multiplying the likelihood of each read observing the base
    |   position being considered.  The probability of error (from 1.) is used when the observed base does not match
    |   the hypothesized base for the underlying source molecule, while one minus that probability is used otherwise.
    |   The computed likelihoods are normalized by dividing them by the sum of all four likelihoods to produce a
    |   posterior probability, namely the probability that the source molecule was an A, C, G, or T from just after
    |   integrating molecular tag through to sequencing, given the observations.  The base with the maximum posterior
    |   probability as the consensus call, and the posterior probability is used as its raw base quality.
    |3. Finally, the consensus raw base quality is modified by incorporating the probability of an error prior to
    |   integrating the unique molecular tags.  Therefore, the probability used for the final consensus base
    |   quality is the posterior probability of the source molecule having the consensus base given the observed
    |   reads with the same molecular tag, all the way from sample extraction and through sample and library
    |   preparation, through preparing the library for sequencing (e.g. amplification, target selection), and finally,
    |   through sequencing.
    |
    |This tool assumes that reads with the same tag are grouped together (consecutive in the file). Also, this tool
    |calls each end of a pair independently, and does not jointly call bases that overlap within a pair.  Insertion or
    |deletion errors in the reads are not considered in the consensus model.
    |
    |Particular attention should be paid to setting the `--min-reads` parameter as this can have a dramatic effect on
    |both results and runtime.  For libraries with low duplication rates (e.g. 100-300X exomes libraries) in which it
    |is desirable to retain singleton reads while making consensus reads from sets of duplicates, `--min-reads=1` is
    |appropriate.  For libraries with high duplication rates where it is desirable to only produce consensus reads
    |supported by 2+ reads to allow error correction, `--min-reads=2` or higher is appropriate.  After generation,
    |consensus reads can be further filtered using the _FilterConsensusReads_ tool.  As such it is always safe to run
    |with `--min-reads=1` and filter later, but filtering at this step can improve performance significantly.
    |
    |Consensus reads have a number of additional optional tags set in the resulting BAM file.  The tags break down into
    |those that are single-valued per read:
    |
    |```
    |consensus depth      [cD] (int)  : the maximum depth of raw reads at any point in the consensus read
    |consensus min depth  [cM] (int)  : the minimum depth of raw reads at any point in the consensus read
    |consensus error rate [cE] (float): the fraction of bases in raw reads disagreeing with the final consensus calls
    |```
    |
    |And those that have a value per base:
    |
    |```
    |consensus depth  [cd] (short[]): the count of bases contributing to the consensus read at each position
    |consensus errors [ce] (short[]): the number of bases from raw reads disagreeing with the final consensus base
    |```
    |
    |The per base depths and errors are both capped at 32,767. In all cases no-calls (`N`s) and bases below the
    |`--min-input-base-quality` are not counted in tag value calculations.
